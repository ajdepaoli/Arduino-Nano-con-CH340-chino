Chinese Arduino Nano CH340 - Sketch Upload Issue  
Problem Description  
Many users experience difficulties when uploading sketches to Chinese Arduino Nano boards equipped with the CH340 USB-to-serial chip. The most common symptoms include:  
- The board is detected, but the upload fails.  
- The bootloader does not synchronize properly.  
- The RESET signal timing is inconsistent.  
Possible Causes  
1️⃣ Incorrect bootloader selection → Some Nano clones require selecting ATmega328P (Old Bootloader) in the Arduino IDE.  
2️⃣ CH340 driver issues → Ensure the correct driver is installed for your operating system.  
3️⃣ Reset circuit instability → The CH340 chip may require adjustments to the reset line for proper synchronization.  
Solution  
✅ Check the bootloader setting → In the Arduino IDE, go to Tools → Processor → ATmega328P (Old Bootloader).  
✅ Install the CH340 driver → Download and install the latest driver for your OS.  
✅ Modify the reset circuit → Some users have improved stability by adjusting the RC time constant with a 10kΩ pull-up resistor and a capacitor.  
✅ Use manual reset → Press the RESET button just before uploading the sketch to force synchronization.
